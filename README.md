# Question
### Why doesn't the integer change after the method call?
Java uses pass-by-value for all method parameters
### Why does the array change after the method call?
The array is not copied but a copy of the reference to the array is passed by value
### What happens when you try to access y outside the loop?
 It is because it is a "cannot find symbol" or "y cannot be resolved to a variable." errors.
